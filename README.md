# Fuzzing Techniques: Advanced Training for Federal Employees and Contractors

## Course Description

TODO

This is the second series of fuzzing essentials trainings for federal employees and contractors.

In this course, we will introduce you to the techniques that underpin fuzzing,
and show you how to incorporate those techniques into your organization. These
techniques will allow you to:

1. Find and prove vulnerabilities with zero false
positives.  Developers love the actual proof-of-concept that demonstrates the
problem, just like a human hacker would provide. Managers love that every
report is actionable. And program managers love the savings from avoiding false
positives, which can account for 25%+ of your security budget.

2. Automatically and continuously improve the test suite, which eliminates
unknowns caused by un-tested or under-tested code. Organizations report up to
70% of their developer time is building test scenarios. Behavior-based fuzzing
expands code coverage for the price of a CPU hour rather than a human work hour.

You will learn with hands-on examples using Mayhem. However, the course is also
generally applicable to anyone who wants to learn how to fuzz, including using
open source tools like AFL, libfuzzer, and honggfuzz.

Weâ€™re excited to have you join us.  We hope you take away fundamental new
skills. But moreso, we also hope you come away with a passion for making appsec
more autonomous.
