# Fuzzing Techniques: Advanced Training for Federal Employees and Contractors

## Course Description

TODO

This is the second series of fuzzing essentials trainings for federal employees and contractors.

You will learn with hands-on examples using Mayhem. However, the course is also
generally applicable to anyone who wants to learn how to fuzz, including using
open source tools like AFL, libfuzzer, and honggfuzz, as well as other pen-testing
tools like Ghidra, gdb, ldd, and more.

Weâ€™re excited to have you join us.  We hope you take away even more new
fuzzing skills. But moreso, we also hope you come away with a passion for making
application security more autonomous.

## Agenda

In this course, we will continue to discuss fuzz testing techniques, centering around
the idea of a pen-testing toolbelt. At the end of the training, you will be able to:

1. Explain What Fuzz Testing Is
2. Give examples of tools in a pen-testing toolbelt
3. Package a target for fuzzing with Mayhem
4. Improve results using a fuzzing corpus or dictionary, and
5. Improve coverage using coverage analysis and patching
